## â˜€ Introduction

Always on a quest to learn new things, I wanted to create a simple project that would allow me to:

1. Try out the Svelte compiler / SvelteKit web app framework
2. Try the [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.7.1/) library (had previously only worked with [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/))
3. Build something related to NFTs ([ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) tokens)

## ðŸ’­ What I learned

I only spent a few hours on this project, focusing on getting the main functionality working. Therefore, I still have to dive deeper into the fundamentals of the previously mentioned technologies to master them properly. Still, I had fun experimenting and those are the main key takeaways I'll remember from this experiment:

- Enjoyed the reactive declaration system. It made me think of the `useEffect` hook in React but in a much cleaner fashion.

```ts
$: console.log(dependency); // This line runs every time the dependency's value changes
```

- Had a look at writable data stores through the [svelte-web3](https://github.com/clbrge/svelte-web3) library I used in the project
- I learned about IPFS and how to retrieve the data through gateways
- Built an API route which very similar to how I would do in NextJS
- Learned that SvelteKit is to Svelte what NextJS is to React

Note: You'll see that MetaMask requests you to connect, feel free to just close the popup. The app will work the same.

## ðŸ’¿ Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node v16 or above
- NPM
- A web browser (Chrome for example) with [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) installed

### Installation steps

First, clone the repository with the following command:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:vcheeney/BoredApesTransfers.git
```

### Usage

Run the development app with the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```
